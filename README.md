CSU22012- Algorithms and Data Structures

Bus Management System based on Vancouver bus system data

Ciaran Healy and Conor Ryan implemented Part 1- Finding the shortest path between two bus stops. They used a 2D array as the data structure and used Dijsktra's shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path between any two stops. 

Moya Whelan implemented Part 2- Searching for a stop by name or a few characters of the name. She used a TST (as stated in the question) to provide this functionality. To move keywords to the end of the stop, she used the functions string.toCharArray()and string.substring().

Laoise Brady implemented Part 3- Searching for all trips with a given arrival time. She used an ArrayList to store objects of type Trip and Transfer and used the LinearSearch algorithm to provide functionality when searching for a stop by its arrival time.

Conor Ryan implemented Part 4- Providing the front interface to enable selection between the above features. While implementing this, he made sure that all possible error checks were carried out.
